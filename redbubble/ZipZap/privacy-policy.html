  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 9, 2025</p>

  <p>At ZipZap, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect limited personal data when you interact with our site or services, including when using integrations with third-party platforms like Pinterest.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Public profile information when you authorize social APIs (e.g., Pinterest)</li>
    <li>Basic usage analytics (e.g., page visits, click behavior)</li>
    <li>Optional user-provided data (if you contact us or use certain tools)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Pinterest API</h2>
  <p>Our application uses the Pinterest API to help users create Pins based on their own content sources. We do not collect or store Pinterest login credentials. Any data accessed via the Pinterest API is used only for the purpose of enabling the user to create and publish Pins with their explicit consent.</p>
  <p>We comply with Pinterestâ€™s Developer Guidelines and require user authorization before accessing Pinterest-related data.</p>

  <h2>Use of Telegram Content</h2>
  <p>Our app may allow users to import publicly available images or content from Telegram groups or channels, provided they own or have permission to use that content. This feature is designed to help content creators repurpose their own materials into Pinterest Pins.</p>
  <p>Users have full control over what content is imported, reviewed, and posted to Pinterest. We do not access private Telegram data, and we do not store Telegram content unless explicitly approved by the user for posting or processing.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may use basic cookies or analytics tools such as Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site. This information helps us improve user experience but does not include personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2>Affiliate Links</h2>
  <p>Some pages may include affiliate links. If you click on these links and make a purchase, we may earn a commission. This does not affect your price or experience.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our site may link to or use third-party services (e.g., Pinterest, Telegram, Google Analytics). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those services. Please refer to their policies for more information.</p>

  <h2>Your Consent</h2>
  <p>By using our website or tools, you consent to our Privacy Policy and data usage practices outlined here.</p>

  <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
